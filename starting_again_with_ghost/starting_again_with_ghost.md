#### Setting up a Ghost Blog
I've been a little busy recently (aren't we all?), and one of the things that dropped off the radar was blogging and blog maintenance. But, I'm back, with a [Ghost](https://ghost.org/) blog hosted on [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/).

It was actually quite easy to get setup, so I leave this post behind for anyone wanting to do the same. [Here's the tutorial I followed](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-the-digitalocean-ghost-application). The tutorial is a few years old, but it was still very good.

#### Looking for old posts?
I had some old Ember posts up, but they are quickly becoming outdated with how fast the framework moves. I do plan to more posts on Ember in the future, but for now all of the code from those posts still exist on [my github.](https://github.com/johnmosesman)
